# iKids Newborn Cognitive Task Stimulus Software (Original Matlab Version)
#### Stimulus Presentation Software for iKids Newborn Cognitive

This repository contains the unedited, original iKids Newborn Cognitive stimulus software, written in Matlab. 

Note: @kevroy314 did not write or modify this, but [iKids Newborn Cognitive Unity](https://github.com/ikids-research/ikids-newborn-cognitive-unity) was modelled on this software.
