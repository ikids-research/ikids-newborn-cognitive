1.0.3 - 2014.07.14 [PDL]
- During data pre-allocation, starting time of each trial was performed only once,
		so all trials have same time-stamp. Fixed with NaN pre-allocation and starting
		time is set at the beginning of each trial.

1.0.2 - 2014.06.11 [PDL]
- "bufferizeSamples" sub-function moved in the main function as a nested function.

		 compared to sub-function and its own script.]

1.0.1 - 2013.12.17 [PDL]
